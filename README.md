# Quick Start üöÄ

### Clone this Repository

``` 
git clone https://github.com/adityajai25/driver-drowsiness-detection.git
```

<h2>Prerequisites to Run :</h2>
    <p>You need to have Python installed on your system, then using pip, you can install the necessary packages.</p>
    <ul>The necessary packages are:
        <li>OpenCV ‚Äì pip install opencv-python (face and eye detection).</li>
        <li>TensorFlow ‚Äì pip install tensorflow (keras uses TensorFlow as backend).</li>
        <li>Keras ‚Äì pip install keras (to build our classification model).</li>
        <li>Pygame ‚Äì pip install pygame (to play alarm sound).</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Dataset :</h2>
    <p>We have used the downloaded the dataset from Kaggle. The dataset is been attached in the github, and you can download the dataset from <a href =https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/serenaraju/yawn-eye-dataset-new">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/serenaraju/yawn-eye-dataset-new </a> as well.</p>

<h2>Execution : </h2>
    <p>To start the project, you need to open a command prompt, go to the directory where our main file main.py‚Äù exists. </p> 

 ###  Run the script with this command.

``` 
python main.py
```

It may take a few seconds to open the webcam and start detection.</p>
